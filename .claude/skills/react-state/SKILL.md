# react-core-state

## Quick Reference

### State Tool Selection

| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Single primitive or simple object | `useState` | Minimal boilerplate, direct updates |
| Complex object with multiple sub-values | `useReducer` | Centralized transitions, predictable logic |
| State needed by distant descendants | Context + `useState`/`useReducer` | Avoids prop drilling |
| High-frequency updates read by many components | External store (Zustand/Jotai) | Bypasses Context re-render cascade |
| Server data (fetched, cached, synced) | TanStack Query / SWR | Handles caching, revalidation, deduplication |
| Optimistic UI during async mutation | `useOptimistic` (React 19) | Instant feedback, automatic rollback |
| Form submission state | `useActionState` (React 19) | Tracks pending state, works with Server Actions |
| Subscribing to non-React store | `useSyncExternalStore` | Tear-free reads, SSR-safe |

### State Placement Decision

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Only this component needs it? | Local `useState` | Keep reading |
| Parent and siblings need it? | Lift to closest common ancestor | Keep reading |
| Many distant components need it? | Context or external store | Keep reading |
| Updates are frequent (>60fps)? | External store with selectors | Context is fine |
| Data comes from the server? | TanStack Query / server state lib | Client state |

## Critical Warnings

**NEVER** mutate state directly. `state.items.push(item)` does NOT trigger a re-render. ALWAYS create a new reference: `setState(prev => [...prev.items, item])`.

**NEVER** store derived values in state. If `fullName` can be computed from `firstName` and `lastName`, compute it during render. Storing it creates sync bugs.

**NEVER** call `useState` or `useReducer` inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. React relies on call order to track state identity.

**NEVER** read state immediately after calling `setState` and expect the new value. State updates apply on the NEXT render.

**NEVER** use Context for high-frequency updates (mouse position, animations). Every consumer re-renders when the context value changes. Use an external store with selectors instead.

**NEVER** create a new context value object on every render without `useMemo`. This defeats `React.memo` on all consumers.

**ALWAYS** use the updater form `setState(prev => prev + 1)` when the next state depends on the previous state. Direct `setState(count + 1)` causes stale closures in batched updates.

**ALWAYS** use an initializer function for expensive initial state: `useState(() => computeExpensive())`, NOT `useState(computeExpensive())`.

## Decision Tree

```
Need to manage data in a React component?
|
+-- Is it server data (API responses, DB records)?
|   YES --> Use TanStack Query or SWR (server state library)
|   NO  |
|       v
+-- Is it a single value or simple object?
|   YES --> useState
|   NO  |
|       v
+-- Does it have complex transitions (multiple fields change together)?
|   YES --> useReducer
|   NO  --> useState with object spread
|
After choosing the hook:
|
+-- Does only THIS component need it?
|   YES --> Keep it local
|   NO  |
|       v
+-- Do a parent and a few siblings need it?
|   YES --> Lift state to closest common ancestor
|   NO  |
|       v
+-- Do many distant components need it?
    |
    +-- Are updates infrequent (theme, locale, auth)?
    |   YES --> Context API
    |   NO  |
    |       v
    +-- Are updates frequent or need fine-grained subscriptions?
        YES --> External store (Zustand, Jotai)
```

## State Patterns

### useState -- Simple Local State

```typescript
const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);
const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

// Updater form -- ALWAYS use when depending on previous state
setCount(prev => prev + 1);

// Lazy initializer -- ALWAYS use for expensive computations
const [data, setData] = useState<ExpensiveData>(() => parseExpensiveData(raw));
```

### useReducer -- Complex State Logic

Use `useReducer` when: multiple state fields change in response to a single event, or state transitions follow business rules.

```typescript
type State = { items: Item[]; status: "idle" | "loading" | "error" };
type Action =
  | { type: "FETCH_START" }
  | { type: "FETCH_SUCCESS"; items: Item[] }
  | { type: "FETCH_ERROR" };

function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "FETCH_START":
      return { ...state, status: "loading" };
    case "FETCH_SUCCESS":
      return { items: action.items, status: "idle" };
    case "FETCH_ERROR":
      return { ...state, status: "error" };
  }
}

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { items: [], status: "idle" });
```

### Context API -- Cross-Cutting State

See [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md) for full Context patterns with `useMemo` optimization.

```typescript
// 1. Create context with typed default
const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme>("light");

// 2. Provider with memoized value
function ThemeProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>("light");
  const value = useMemo(() => ({ theme, setTheme }), [theme]);
  return <ThemeContext value={value}>{children}</ThemeContext>;
}

// 3. Consumer hook
function useTheme() {
  return useContext(ThemeContext);
}
```

### External Stores -- High-Performance Global State

Use when Context re-renders too many components. See [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md) for Zustand/Jotai examples.

```typescript
// Zustand -- minimal API, selector-based subscriptions
import { create } from "zustand";

const useStore = create<StoreState>((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set((s) => ({ count: s.count + 1 })),
}));

// Component only re-renders when count changes
function Counter() {
  const count = useStore((s) => s.count);
  return <span>{count}</span>;
}
```

### useSyncExternalStore -- Non-React Store Subscription

```typescript
function useOnlineStatus(): boolean {
  return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot);
}

function subscribe(callback: () => void) {
  window.addEventListener("online", callback);
  window.addEventListener("offline", callback);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener("online", callback);
    window.removeEventListener("offline", callback);
  };
}

function getSnapshot(): boolean { return navigator.onLine; }
function getServerSnapshot(): boolean { return true; }
```

## Anti-Patterns

See [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) for complete anti-pattern catalog with fixes.

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Direct mutation | No re-render | Create new reference |
| Storing derived state | Sync bugs | Compute during render |
| Props in state (mirror) | Stale data | Use props directly or key reset |
| Context for frequent updates | Re-render cascade | External store with selectors |
| Missing updater form | Stale closures | `setState(prev => ...)` |
| Overly broad context | Unrelated re-renders | Split into focused contexts |

## Version Notes (React 18 vs 19)

### React 18
- `useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`, `useSyncExternalStore` available
- Automatic batching in event handlers, timeouts, promises (new in 18)
- `startTransition` for non-urgent updates

### React 19 Additions
- **`useActionState`**: Replaces `useFormState`. Returns `[state, action, isPending]`. Supports async reducers with side effects. Works with Server Actions and `<form action={...}>`.
- **`useOptimistic`**: Immediate UI updates during async actions. Automatically rolls back on failure. Must be called inside a Transition or Action.
- **Context as provider**: Use `<Context value={...}>` directly instead of `<Context.Provider value={...}>` (Provider syntax still works but is deprecated).
- **Server Components**: Server Components have NO state. They render once on the server. ALWAYS place stateful logic in Client Components (`"use client"`).
